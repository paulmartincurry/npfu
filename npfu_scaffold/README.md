# NPFU — Nazi Punks F*** Off (prototype)

This repository contains a prototype of **NPFU**, a side‑scrolling beat ’em up inspired by the antifascist punk scene from 1977–1995. The prototype is built with Phaser 3 and Vite and showcases basic movement, combat, a rebel meter that triggers Riot Mode, and a simple UI.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local development server URL that Vite prints in your terminal.

## Controls

- **← / →** — move left and right
- **Space** — jump
- **Z** — punch
- **ESC** — pause / resume
